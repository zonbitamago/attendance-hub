# Specification Quality Checklist: 入力欄テキスト視認性の改善

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Date**: 2025-11-06
**Status**: ✅ All checks passed

### Key Findings

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All mandatory sections properly filled with concrete details
- No clarifications needed - scope is clear and well-defined
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User scenarios cover all primary flows (light mode, dark mode, placeholder distinction)
- Edge cases properly identified (color scheme changes, high contrast mode, custom themes)
- Scope clearly bounded to 9 specific input fields across 3 pages

## Notes

✅ Specification quality validation complete. Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan`
